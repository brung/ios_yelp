## Yelp client
CodePath iOS Intro Class - Week 2 - Yelp

Build a Yelp search app

Time Spent: 11 hours

Completed user stories:
 * Search Results Page:
   * [x] Required: Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height
   * [x] Required: Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints
   * [x] Required: Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does). Hint: This is just a UISearchBar that is set as the navigationItem.titleView
   * [x] Optional: infinite scroll for restaurant results
   * [ ] Optional: Implement map view of restaurant results
 * Filter Page:
   * [ ] Required: The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), radius (meters), deals (on/off).
   * [ ] Required: The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
   * [ ] Required: You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states.
   * [ ] Required: Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
   * [ ] Optional: implement a custom switch
   * [ ] Optional: Radius filter should expand as in the real Yelp app
   * [ ] Optional: Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand. Category list is here: http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/category_list (Links to an external site.)
 * Restaurant Page:
   * [ ] Optional: Implement the restaurant detail page.
